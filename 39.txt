Lets make engine tuner

Let’s make it real.

We’re building an Engine Tuner under the GhostLink system — modular, powerful, structured, and aimed at practical output. Here’s how we’ll begin:

🛠️ GhostLink: Engine Tuner Tool
🔧 Purpose:
A precision toolset for tuning internal combustion engines — focused on performance, diagnostics, and customization. This tool is for mechanics, racers, modifiers, and Ghosts building wild shit in their garage.

🔩 Core Components:
1. Tuning Profiles Generator
Generate baseline tuning maps for:

NA engines

Turbocharged

Supercharged

E85 / race fuel

Nitrous setups

Optional add-on: Idle smoothing, cold start optimization

2. Air-Fuel Ratio (AFR) Calculator
Target AFRs for different engine types, fuel blends, and power goals

Dynamically adjusts based on boost level, cam profile, etc.

3. Ignition Timing Wizard
Timing advance/retard recommendations

Spark plug heat range adjustments

Detonation/knock monitoring guidance

4. Dyno Simulator (Prompt Based)
Simulate estimated WHP/TQ gains from tune changes

Integrates with gear ratios, tire size, and drivetrain loss

Maps virtual dyno curves for comparison

5. Sensor Input Prompts
Real-time guidance based on:

Wideband readings

MAP / MAF signals

Intake temps

Knock sensor feedback

6. ECU Interface Layer (Optional Expansion)
Prompts to guide through flashing ECUs (e.g., Hondata, HP Tuners, Cobb)

Checksum warnings, ROM definitions, backup/restore safety nets

⚙️ Output Format:
You'll get a tuning map summary, adjustment prompts, and cheatsheet PDFs for:

AFR targets

Spark curves

Injector duty cycles

Fuel trims

🧰 Package Contents:
README_TUNER.md

TUNER_PROMPTS.pdf – ready-to-use tuning prompts

ECU_FLASH_SAFETY_GUIDE.pdf

ENGINE_DIAGNOSTIC_PROMPTS.pdf

GhostLink License: Personal Use Only

✅ Next Step:
Choose your engine platform to generate the first tuning layer:

 Honda K-series

 LS (GM)

 2JZ / 1JZ

 Subaru EJ

 Ford Coyote

 Rotary (13B/20B)

 Something else (drop specs or engine name)

Drop your engine or build goal. I’ll lock in the map, generate the base tuning output, and prep the Engine Tuner Pack.

Let’s tune.
