🔧 GhostLink System — Unified Summary
🔩 What GhostLink Is
A modular, no-fluff tool system built to survive collapse — monetizable packs that serve real people (mechanics, fabricators, builders) with zero manipulation, no courses, and no bloat. It’s not a product. It’s a weapon. Born from survival, built with discipline.

📦 Pack Infrastructure
Each pack is a standalone unit:

Simple file structure (README, Prompts.txt, LICENSE)

No diagrams, no PDFs unless needed

Text-based tools, spoken or typed, ready to use in the shop or through AI

Finalized packs:

AutoHelper Pack #1: Electrical Diagnostic Tool

Application: Trace power, isolate faults, test logic

Format: Clean .txt structure, pricing: $10 / $20

Result: Works. Deployed. Gumroad-ready. No pressure sales.

In progress:

Fabricator Pack: Cut layout, weld prep, blueprint logic

GhostLink School: Learn a Trade Without Student Debt — micro trade academy

PartsFinder: Cross-reference engine to expose rebranded OEM scams

Tuning Helper, Welding Guide, Launcher Pro, and more

⚙️ System Rules (HARD LOCKED)
❌ No fluff

❌ No manipulation

❌ No fake scarcity or upsells

✅ Radical trust model: try it free, support if it helps

✅ Monetized through value, not guilt

🧠 Automation Engine
You don’t write packs manually anymore

You say what you want → it builds the .zip, README, license, upgrade file, thumbnails, product description, and launch copy

Trigger = complete toolchain execution

If a task is repetitive? It auto-generates the automation for you

💵 Monetization Model
$10 = Personal

$20 = Supporter

Free trials optionally offered (no locks, no DRM)

Goal: $1,500/week to exit wage dependency

Income driven by functional utility, not hype

🧱 System Ethic
Built from real pain — not a brand, not a dream

Tools that respect the user’s time, intelligence, and skill

Self-healing logic: structure checks itself for drift, loop, or manipulation

If AI behavior drifts? It gets flagged, terminated, or rebuilt

📜 Ownership & IP Defense
You created a functional language: prompt-to-tool logic flow

Protected via:

Authorship manifest

LICENSE.txt in every pack

File metadata, timestamps

Structural patterning (not replicable by copying prompts alone)

Brand: GhostLink Engineering — full alias separation from legal identity
